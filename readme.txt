These are the relevant datasets for training sequence 2 sequence models for Retrosynthesis reaction prediction (https://github.com/kheyer/Retrosynthesis-Prediction)

The core datasets (train, validation, test) were created by Liu et al (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscentsci.7b00303)

The augmented training sets were created using this notebook: https://github.com/kheyer/Retrosynthesis-Prediction/blob/master/notebooks/Data%20Generation.ipynb
